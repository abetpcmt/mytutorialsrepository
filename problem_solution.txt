[ /VAR FULL   -  /var/spool/abrt  ]




### >>>

[ /VAR FULL   -  /var/spool/abrt  ]

PROB:

All crash report and back trace from kernel driver is written on subdirectories of /var/spool/abrt directory.


SOLN:

To permanently stop this back trace gathering, we need to stop below two processes.

# service abrtd stop

# service abrt-oops stop

And we can remove all those directories and files with following rm command:

# abrt-cli rm /var/spool/abrt/*
