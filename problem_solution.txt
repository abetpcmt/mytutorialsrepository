[ /VAR FULL   -  /var/spool/abrt  ]

PROB:

All crash report and back trace from kernel driver is written on subdirectories of /var/spool/abrt directory.


SOLN:

To permanently stop this back trace gathering, we need to stop below two processes.

# service abrtd stop
# service abrt-oops stop

And we can remove all those directories and files with following rm command:

# abrt-cli rm /var/spool/abrt/*

# service abrtd start
# service abrt-oops start


OR  

We want to simplify the deletion process as the following -- 
it will delete the directories that are older than 10 days from /var/spool/abrt/

	# find /var/spool/abrt/  -type d -ctime +10  -exec rm -rf {} \;


OR 

Cleanup script (run it of put it on crontab -e)

$ cat purgeabrt.sh

#!/bin/bash
set -e			### will terminate the execution of the script if a command exits with a non-zero status.  
function cleanup()
{
    systemctl start abrtd
    systemctl start abrt-oops
}

trap cleanup EXIT      ### will catch signals that may be thrown to the script and executes the cleanup code.

systemctl stop abrtd
systemctl stop abrt-oops
find /var/spool/abrt/ -type d -ctime +10 -exec abrt-cli rm {} \;
cleanup


sudo crontab -e
